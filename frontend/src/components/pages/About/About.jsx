                <h1>Learning Can Be fun and we can help you see it!</h1>
                <p>
                    Project Bangladesh envisions the empowerment of 
                    people by providing them with convenient and easy learning methods. This will be a 
                    place where you'll find fellow knowledge seekers with different points of views, 
                    which will give you an opportunity to meet new people, socialize with them and through that, 
                    learn to think outside the box. One of our main objectives is to make learning accessible and 
                    effortless to the members of the communities that lack information and financial resources. We believe that scarcity should not be an obstacle that blocks the path towards knowledge and everyone should have the chance to achieve equal opportunity.

                <h1>Who We Are</h1>
                <p>
                    Project Bangladesh is a non-profit educational organization, 
                    which is led by students of different universities of Bangladesh. Our goal is to make 
                    education accessible to everyone, 
                    especially the youth who have limited access to necessary resources required to be a 
                    skillful candidate in this competitive society
                </p>
                <h1>Our Mission</h1>
                <p>
                    Project Bangladesh envisions a country where the conversation about
                    various existing social problems doesn’t just end in vain complaints, but also
                    encourages the youth to talk about possible and effective solutions. We are at a
                    time when young people make up about 16 percent of the global population. It is
                    impossible to think about progress without including them in the process. Students
                    in Bangladesh today are well informed about world politics &amp; policies, and often
                    come up with excellent solutions that can contribute greatly in combating many of
                    the problems Bangladesh is currently facing. We believe that through conversation,
                    we can bring to light the roots of these problems and find valid and intelligent
                    ways to deal with them. There are various platforms in which students are given
                    the opportunity to talk about these ideas, but sadly, due to improper or no
                    documentation, the results of these potential conversations never see the light of
                    day. We aim to provide a platform where the students have every tool they need to
                    transform these ideas into realities.

                <h1>Our Vision</h1>
                <p>
                    Project Bangladesh envisions a society where every young person is well
                    educated, skilled and empowered. Today, owing to the ever growing development
                    in technology, we have the means to access various information and transmit such
                    knowledge just with a tap of a few buttons. Education is no longer confined inside
                    the four walls of a classroom, and no library or book is too far to reach. Internet
                    has given us the opportunity of educating children and youth in areas and places
                    where it might’ve been impossible to do so just a few decades ago. At the same
                    time, youths of today are the most well-connected generation in the history of
                    mankind. Project Bangladesh aims to take full advantage of this opportunity and
                    create a country where every young person has access to education despite poverty
                    or not having a school in their area. We also want to inform and train people about
                    various skills they will need beside education so that will help them to prepare to
                    utilize their fullest potentials. We believe that when a young person is educated, it
                    not only gives him the chance to change his own life, but also the lives of others in
                    his community, in his country. Children today will become the leaders of
                    tomorrow. The dreams of a better, brighter future can be transformed into reality
                    only by empowering the youths of today.
